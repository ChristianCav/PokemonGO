        "Bulbasaur can be seen napping in bright sunlight. There is a seed on its back. By soaking up the sun’s rays, the seed grows progressively larger.",
        "There is a bud on this Pokémon’s back. To support its weight, Ivysaur’s legs and trunk grow thick and strong. If it starts spending more time lying in the sunlight, it’s a sign that the bud will bloom into a large flower soon.",
        "There is a large flower on Venusaur’s back. The flower is said to take on vivid colors if it gets plenty of nutrition and sunlight. The flower’s aroma soothes the emotions of people.",
        "The flame that burns at the tip of its tail is an indication of its emotions. The flame wavers when Charmander is enjoying itself. If the Pokémon becomes enraged, the flame burns fiercely.",
        "Charmeleon mercilessly destroys its foes using its sharp claws. If it encounters a strong foe, it turns aggressive. In this excited state, the flame at the tip of its tail flares with a bluish white color.",
        "Charizard flies around the sky in search of powerful opponents. It breathes fire of such great heat that it melts anything. However, it never turns its fiery breath on any opponent weaker than itself.",
        "Squirtle’s shell is not merely used for protection. The shell’s rounded shape and the grooves on its surface help minimize resistance in water, enabling this Pokémon to swim at high speeds.",
        "Its tail is large and covered with a rich, thick fur. The tail becomes increasingly deeper in color as Wartortle ages. The scratches on its shell are evidence of this Pokémon’s toughness as a battler.",
        "Blastoise has water spouts that protrude from its shell. The water spouts are very accurate. They can shoot bullets of water with enough accuracy to strike empty cans from a distance of over 160 feet.",
        "Its body is soft and weak. In nature, its perpetual fate is to be seen by others as food.",
        "Its hard shell doesn’t crack a bit even if Pikipek pecks at it, but it will tip over, spilling out its insides.",
        "Nectar from pretty flowers is its favorite food. In fields of flowers, it has heated battles with Cutiefly for territory.",
        "Weedle has an extremely acute sense of smell. It is capable of distinguishing its favorite kinds of leaves from those it dislikes just by sniffing with its big red proboscis (nose).",
        "Kakuna remains virtually immobile as it clings to a tree. However, on the inside, it is extremely busy as it prepares for its coming evolution. This is evident from how hot the shell becomes to the touch.",
        "Beedrill is extremely territorial. No one should ever approach its nest—this is for their own safety. If angered, they will attack in a furious swarm.",
        "Pidgey has an extremely sharp sense of direction. It is capable of unerringly returning home to its nest, however far it may be removed from its familiar surroundings.",
        "Pidgeotto claims a large area as its own territory. This Pokémon flies around, patrolling its living space. If its territory is violated, it shows no mercy in thoroughly punishing the foe with its sharp claws.",
        "This Pokémon has a dazzling plumage of beautifully glossy feathers. Many Trainers are captivated by the striking beauty of the feathers on its head, compelling them to choose Pidgeot as their Pokémon.",
        "This Pokémon is common but hazardous. Its sharp incisors can easily cut right through hard wood.",
        "Its whiskers are essential for maintaining its balance. No matter how friendly you are, it will get angry and bite you if you touch its whiskers.",
        "Due to its short wings, it can’t fly long distances. It wanders about restlessly and pecks at bug Pokémon.",
        "In Alola, fish Pokémon are its prey. It can be seen circling above the ocean searching for food.",
        "The eggs of bird Pokémon are its favorite food. It swallows eggs whole, so sometimes an egg gets stuck, and Ekans faints.",
        "After stunning its opponents with the pattern on its stomach, it quickly wraps them up in its body and waits for them to stop moving.",
        "While sleeping, it generates electricity in the sacs in its cheeks. If it’s not getting enough sleep, it will be able to use only weak electricity.",
        "Because so many Trainers like the way Pikachu looks, you don’t see this Pokémon very often.",
        "When its skin gets wrinkled from moisture, it heads for a volcano. It lies flat on a spot with a lot of geothermal heat and dries itself out.",
        "Thanks to its thick claws, it’s good at climbing trees. There are plenty of Sandslash that park themselves in trees and go right to sleep.",
        "Nidoran♀ has barbs that secrete a powerful poison. They are thought to have developed as protection for this small-bodied Pokémon. When enraged, it releases a horrible toxin from its horn.",
        "When Nidorina are with their friends or family, they keep their barbs tucked away to prevent hurting each other. This Pokémon appears to become nervous if separated from the others.",
        "Nidoqueen’s body is encased in extremely hard scales. It is adept at sending foes flying with harsh tackles. This Pokémon is at its strongest when it is defending its young.",
        "Nidoran♂ has developed muscles for moving its ears. Thanks to them, the ears can be freely moved in any direction. Even the slightest sound does not escape this Pokémon’s notice.",
        "Nidorino has a horn that is harder than a diamond. If it senses a hostile presence, all the barbs on its back bristle up at once, and it challenges the foe with all its might.",
        "Nidoking’s thick tail packs enormously destructive power. With one swing, it can topple a metal transmission tower. Once this Pokémon goes on a rampage, there is no stopping it.",
        "Bathed in moonlight, its wings glow faintly. Without even flapping, Clefairy rises into the air, where it dances around.",
        "Some scientists believe that it gazes intently at the sky on nights with a full moon because it’s homesick.",
        "It manipulates balls of fire to catch its prey. If you raise one from when it’s young, it will grow close to you like a puppy Pokémon.",
        "The flickering flames it spews from its mouth leave its opponents hypnotized. Then, this extremely intelligent Pokémon attacks.",
        "The songs they sing are totally different depending on the region they live in. Some even sound like they’re shouting!",
        "When it gets angry, it inhales with all its might, and its body gradually inflates. Sometimes they can grow 20 times larger!",
        "Their skin is so thin that they’ll be burned if sunlight hits them. When it gets cold out, they gather together to warm one another’s bodies.",
        "They can suck down over 10 ounces of blood in one go. They have been known to drink so much blood that they can no longer fly.",
        "Oddish searches for fertile, nutrient-rich soil, then plants itself. During the daytime, while it is planted, this Pokémon’s feet are thought to change shape and become similar to the roots of trees.",
        "From its mouth Gloom drips honey that smells absolutely horrible. Apparently, it loves the horrid stench. It sniffs the noxious fumes and then drools even more of its honey.",
        "Vileplume has the world’s largest petals. They are used to attract prey that are then doused with toxic spores. Once the prey are immobilized, this Pokémon catches and devours them.",
        "The mushrooms, known as tochukaso, are controlling the bug. Even if the bug bugs the mushrooms, they tell it to bug off.",
        "Its poisonous spores are also used in traditional medicine. Apparently, spores produced in Alola are not of very good quality.",
        "Venonat is said to have evolved with a coat of thin, stiff hair that covers its entire body for protection. It possesses large eyes that never fail to spot even minuscule prey.",
        "Venomoth is nocturnal—it is a Pokémon that only becomes active at night. Its favorite prey are small insects that gather around streetlights, attracted by the light in the darkness.",
        "Around their crops, farmers plant the kind of tree that Diglett like to eat as a way of getting Diglett to plow the fields for them.",
        "Dugtrio’s heads are sleek and smooth and incredibly hard. It can dig through any soil with its headbutts.",
        "It loves coins, so if you give it one, you can make friends with Meowth easily. But it’s fickle, so you can’t count on that friendship lasting.",
        "This Pokémon is popular with rich people. It’s also targeted by hunters who are after the jewel in its forehead.",
        "It has been found that its brain cells are 10 times more active when Psyduck is experiencing a headache.",
        "A professional swimmer, it can continue swimming for two days straight by waving its long tail skillfully.",
        "If one gets angry, all the others around it will get angry, so silence is a rare visitor in a troop of Mankey.",
        "The blood vessels in its brain are sturdier than those of other Pokémon, so it can stay healthy despite its constant raging.",
        "It has lived alongside humans since ages ago. Its bones have been found in excavations of ruins from the Stone Age.",
        "There are so many old tales about them that they’re called legendary Pokémon, but there are way more of them around than you’d expect.",
        "The direction of the swirl on their stomachs differs depending on where they live. Poliwag aficionados can tell them apart at a glance.",
        "Its health suffers when its skin dries out, so be sure to moisturize it diligently.",
        "The muscles it has developed through swimming are thick and powerful. When it lands a square punch, it can turn huge boulders to dust.",
        "It can read others’ minds and will teleport away when danger approaches. You must clear your mind if you want to catch it.",
        "It possesses strong mental capabilities, but its psychic powers are halved when it’s not holding a silver spoon.",
        "If it trusts someone deeply, it will let them have one of its spoons. Anything you eat with that spoon is apparently delicious.",
        "It likes food that’s highly nutritious because its instincts drive it to build muscle efficiently.",
        "A popular motif for sculptures, its incredibly well-developed muscles have captured the imagination of many an artist.",
        "With four arms, it can attack and defend simultaneously. It’s said to have mastered every martial art in the world.",
        "Bellsprout’s thin and flexible body lets it bend and sway to avoid any attack, however strong it may be. From its mouth, this Pokémon spits a corrosive fluid that melts even iron.",
        "Weepinbell has a large hook on its rear end. At night, the Pokémon hooks on to a tree branch and goes to sleep. If it moves around in its sleep, it may wake up to find itself on the ground.",
        "Victreebel has a long vine that extends from its head. This vine is waved and flicked about as if it were an animal to attract prey. When an unsuspecting prey draws near, this Pokémon swallows it whole.",
        "Its body is 99% water. The remaining 1% contains the organ that makes its poison.",
        "It communicates with others of its kind by lighting up the red orbs on its head. When the orbs are blinking, it’s a warning sign.",
        "It uses both hands to climb precipitous cliffs. People who see it in action have been known to take up bouldering.",
        "It travels by rolling down cliffs. If it falls into a river, it will explode with its last gasp.",
        "It detonates its own body. The power from that explosion can propel it up steep mountain paths with amazing speed.",
        "Ponyta is very weak at birth. It can barely stand up. This Pokémon becomes stronger by stumbling and falling to keep up with its parent.",
        "Rapidash usually can be seen casually cantering in the fields and plains. However, when this Pokémon turns serious, its fiery manes flare and blaze as it gallops its way up to 150 mph.",
        "Although their tails, which fall off naturally, can easily be found lying around, they’re a precious ingredient for cooking.",
        "Shellder, in its greed to suck out more and more sweetness from Slowbro’s tail, has metamorphosed into a spiral-shaped shell.",
        "Perhaps because electrical lines are often buried these days, the number of Magnemite attacks on power plants has increased.",
        "When rain clouds form, many Magneton gather in high places to wait for lightning to strike.",
        "Farfetch’d is always seen with a stalk from a plant of some sort. Apparently, there are good stalks and bad stalks. This Pokémon has been known to fight with others over stalks.",
        "Doduo’s two heads contain completely identical brains. A scientific study reported that on rare occasions, there will be examples of this Pokémon possessing different sets of brains.",
        "Apparently, the heads aren’t the only parts of the body that Dodrio has three of. It has three sets of hearts and lungs as well, so it is capable of running long distances without rest.",
        "Thanks to its thick fat, cold seas don’t bother it at all, but it gets tired pretty easily in warm waters.",
        "It sunbathes on the beach after meals. The rise in its body temperature helps its digestion.",
        "The wastewater coming from factories is clean these days, so Grimer have nothing to eat. They’re said to be on the verge of extinction.",
        "Because they scatter germs everywhere, they’ve long been targeted for extermination, leading to a steep decline in their population.",
        "Even when its shell is closed, its tongue still hangs out. If you give its tongue a good yank, the shock will cause Shellder to open its shell.",
        "Slowpoke tails are its favorite food. It has even been known to come up on land to look for Slowpoke from time to time.",
        "Poisonous gas comprises 95% of its body. It’s said that the remaining 5% is made up of the souls of those who died from the gas.",
        "It’s dangerous to go outside alone on nights when you’re feeling sad. Haunter will catch you, and you won’t be able to go back home.",
        "Even your home isn’t safe. Gengar will lurk in whatever dark corner of a room it can find and wait for its chance to catch its prey.",
        "Onix has a magnet in its brain. It acts as a compass so that this Pokémon does not lose direction while it is tunneling. As it grows older, its body becomes increasingly rounder and smoother.",
        "It puts its prey to sleep and devours their dreams. It seems that bad dreams taste sour, so Drowzee doesn’t particularly like eating them.",
        "There are some Hypno that assist doctors with patients who can’t sleep at night in hospitals.",
        "Krabby live on beaches, burrowed inside holes dug into the sand. On sandy beaches with little in the way of food, these Pokémon can be seen squabbling with each other over territory.",
        "Kingler has an enormous, oversized claw. It waves this huge claw in the air to communicate with others. However, because the claw is so heavy, the Pokémon quickly tires.",
        "Voltorb is extremely sensitive—it explodes at the slightest of shocks. It is rumored that it was first created when a Poké Ball was exposed to a powerful pulse of energy.",
        "One of Electrode’s characteristics is its attraction to electricity. It is a problematical Pokémon that congregates mostly at electrical power plants to feed on electricity that has just been generated.",
        "Although they are the same size as other Exeggcute, the ones produced in Alola are quite heavy. Their shells are packed full.",
        "Each of its three heads has its own thoughts. When they want to go in different directions, Exeggutor becomes unable to move.",
        "It wears its mother’s skull on its head, so no one knows what its bare face looks like. However, it’s clear that it’s always crying.",
        "They thump their bones rhythmically to communicate among themselves. There are nearly 50 different rhythmic patterns.",
        "Hitmonlee’s legs freely contract and stretch. Using these springlike legs, it bowls over foes with devastating kicks. After battle, it rubs down its legs and loosens the muscles to overcome fatigue.",
        "Hitmonchan is said to possess the spirit of a boxer who had been working toward a world championship. This Pokémon has an indomitable spirit and will never give up in the face of adversity.",
        "It licks filth clean with its tongue. Whatever it licks always stinks afterward, so whether it’s really clean is...questionable.",
        "Koffing embodies toxic substances. It mixes the toxins with raw garbage to set off a chemical reaction that results in a terribly powerful poison gas. The higher the temperature, the more gas is concocted by this Pokémon.",
        "Weezing alternately shrinks and inflates its twin bodies to mix together toxic gases inside. The more the gases are mixed, the more powerful the toxins become. The Pokémon also becomes more putrid.",
        "Rhyhorn’s brain is very small. It is so dense, while on a run it forgets why it started running in the first place. It apparently remembers sometimes if it demolishes something.",
        "Rhydon has a horn that serves as a drill. It is used for destroying rocks and boulders. This Pokémon occasionally rams into streams of magma, but the armor-like hide prevents it from feeling the heat.",
        "Because the eggs on their bellies have been overharvested by people in the past, the Chansey population remains very small.",
        "Tangela’s vines snap off easily if they are grabbed. This happens without pain, allowing it to make a quick getaway. The lost vines are replaced by newly grown vines the very next day.",
        "You shouldn’t get close to the child when it’s playing outside its mother’s pouch. Its mother is always nearby watching over it.",
        "If Horsea senses danger, it will reflexively spray a dense black ink from its mouth and try to escape. This Pokémon swims by cleverly flapping the fin on its back.",
        "Seadra generates whirlpools by spinning its body. The whirlpools are strong enough to swallow even fishing boats. This Pokémon weakens prey with these currents, then swallows it whole.",
        "The way it swims along fluttering its dress-like fins has earned it the name “princess of the water.”",
        "To attract females, males dance on the river’s floor. The females gather around the male that dances most gracefully.",
        "No number of injuries can bother Staryu. Its amazing regenerative powers return it to its previous state in half a day!",
        "It rotates its geometrically shaped body to swim through the water. It always seems to be sending out mysterious radio waves.",

        "Although its outer shell is uncommonly durable, the shock of falling to the ground smashes the shell to smithereens.",
        "It remains asleep from birth to death as a result of the sedative properties of the leaves that form its diet.",
        "Its exploding shell poses a real danger but is sensitive to moisture. On rainy days, Turtonator takes silent refuge in caves.",
        "Its capacity to produce electricity is somewhat limited, so it gets charged up by letting lightning strike it!",
        "A gust of wind revealed what hides under this Pokémon’s rag to a passing Trainer, who went home and died painfully that very night.",
        "Its skin is thick enough to fend off Mareanie’s spikes. With its robust teeth, Bruxish crunches up the spikes and eats them.",
        "It appears in towns and plays with the children. Drampa will protect kids when they’re in danger, so their moms don’t have to worry.",
        "Its chain-like green seaweed can stretch outward for hundreds of yards. For some reason, it gets along well with Skrelp.",
        "It will never show an enemy its back in battle. Ancient warriors liked Jangmo-o for its valiant disposition and made it one of their own.",
        "The scales it sheds can be molded and processed to make pots and pans. They conduct heat well, so they’re a popular item.",
        "It battles valiantly with its fists, which are armored in steel scales. Kommo-o specializes in uppercuts.",
        "The lightning-wielding guardian deity of Melemele, Tapu Koko is brimming with curiosity and appears before people from time to time.",
        "Although called a guardian deity, Tapu Lele is devoid of guilt about its cruel disposition and can be described as nature incarnate.",
        "It makes ringing sounds with its tail to let others know where it is, avoiding unneeded conflicts. This guardian deity of Ula’ula controls plants.",
        "Although it’s called a guardian deity, terrible calamities sometimes befall those who recklessly approach Tapu Fini.",
        "Whether or not it’s a Pokémon from this world is a mystery. When it’s in a jam, it warps away to a safe place to hide.",
        "As it absorbs light, Cosmoem continues to grow. Its golden shell is surprisingly solid.",
        "In writings from the distant past, it’s called by the name “the beast that devours the sun.”",
        "It sometimes summons unknown powers and life-forms here to this world from holes that lead to other worlds.",
        "It appeared in this world from an Ultra Wormhole. Nihilego appears to be a parasite that lives by feeding on people and Pokémon.",
        "Buzzwole goes around showing off its abnormally swollen muscles. It is one kind of Ultra Beast.",
        "Although it’s alien to this world and a danger here, it’s apparently a common organism in the world where it normally lives.",
        "They’ve been dubbed Ultra Beasts. Some of them stand unmoving, like trees, with their arms and legs stuck into the ground.",
        "Although it’s alien to this world and a danger here, it’s apparently a common organism in the world where it normally lives.",
        "Although it’s alien to this world and a danger here, it’s apparently a common organism in the world where it normally lives.",
        "An unknown life-form called a UB. It may be constantly hungry—it is certainly always devouring something.",
        "Light is the source of its energy. If it isn’t devouring light, impurities build up in it and on it, and Necrozma darkens and stops moving.",
        "Built roughly 500 years ago by a scientist, the part called the Soul-Heart is the actual life-form.",
        "It sinks into the shadows of people and Pokémon, where it can understand their feelings and copy their capabilities.",
        "An Ultra Beast that lives in a different world, it cackles wildly as it sprays its opponents with poison from the needles on its head.",
        "One kind of Ultra Beast, it fires a glowing, venomous liquid from its needles. This liquid is also immensely adhesive.",
        "When stone walls started moving and attacking, the brute’s true identity was this mysterious life-form, which brings to mind an Ultra Beast.",
        "A UB that appeared from an Ultra Wormhole, it causes explosions, then takes advantage of opponents’ surprise to rob them of their vitality.",
        "It approaches its enemies at the speed of lightning, then tears them limb from limb with its sharp claws.",
        "They live as a group, but when the time comes, one strong Meltan will absorb all the others and evolve.",
        "Centrifugal force is behind the punches of Melmetal's heavy hex-nut arms. Melmetal is said to deliver the strongest punches of all Pokémon.",
        "It attacks with rapid beats of its stick. As it strikes with amazing speed, it gets more and more pumped.",
        "When it’s drumming out rapid beats in battle, it gets so caught up in the rhythm that it won’t even notice that it’s already knocked out its opponent.",
        "The one with the best drumming techniques becomes the boss of the troop. It has a gentle disposition and values harmony among its group.",
        "It has special pads on the backs of its feet, and one on its nose. Once it’s raring to fight, these pads radiate tremendous heat.",
        "It kicks berries right off the branches of trees and then juggles them with its feet, practicing its footwork.",
        "It’s skilled at both offense and defense, and it gets pumped up when cheered on. But if it starts showboating, it could put itself in a tough spot.",
        "When it gets wet, its skin changes color, and this Pokémon becomes invisible as if it were camouflaged.",
        "Highly intelligent but also very lazy, it keeps enemies out of its territory by laying traps everywhere.",
        "Its nictitating membranes let it pick out foes’ weak points so it can precisely blast them with water that shoots from its fingertips at Mach 3.",
        "It eats berries nonstop—a habit that has made it more resilient than it looks. It’ll show up on farms, searching for yet more berries.",
        "Common throughout the Galar region, this Pokémon has strong teeth and can chew through the toughest of berry shells.",
        "Jumping nimbly about, this small-bodied Pokémon takes advantage of even the slightest opportunity to disorient larger opponents.",
        "The lessons of many harsh battles have taught it how to accurately judge an opponent’s strength.",
        "With their great intellect and flying skills, these Pokémon very successfully act as the Galar region’s airborne taxi service.",
        "Often found in gardens, this Pokémon has hairs on its body that it uses to assess its surroundings.",
        "As it grows inside its shell, it uses its psychic abilities to monitor the outside world and prepare for evolution.",
        "It emits psychic energy to observe and study what’s around it—and what’s around it can include things over six miles away.",
        "Cunning and cautious, this Pokémon survives by stealing food from others. It erases its tracks with swipes of its tail as it makes off with its plunder.",
        "With a lithe body and sharp claws, it goes around stealing food and eggs. Boltund is its natural enemy.",
        "It whirls around in the wind while singing a joyous song. This delightful display has charmed many into raising this Pokémon.",
        "The cotton on the head of this Pokémon can be spun into a glossy, gorgeous yarn—a Galar regional specialty.",
        "If its fleece grows too long, Wooloo won’t be able to move. Cloth made with the wool of this Pokémon is surprisingly strong.",
        "Its majestic horns are meant only to impress the opposite gender. They never see use in battle.",
        "It starts off battles by attacking with its rock-hard horn, but as soon as the opponent flinches, this Pokémon bites down and never lets go.",
        "This Pokémon rapidly extends its retractable neck to sink its sharp fangs into distant enemies and take them down.",
        "This gluttonous Pokémon only assists people with their work because it wants treats. As it runs, it crackles with electricity.",
        "It sends electricity through its legs to boost their strength. Running at top speed, it easily breaks 50 mph.",
        "It can race around like a unicycle, even on rough, rocky terrain. Burning coal sustains it.",
        "By rapidly rolling its legs, it can travel at over 18 mph. The temperature of the flames it breathes exceeds 1,800 degrees Fahrenheit.",
        "While it’s engaged in battle, its mountain of coal will burn bright red, sending off sparks that scorch the surrounding area.",
        "As soon as it’s born, it burrows into an apple. Not only does the apple serve as its food source, but the flavor of the fruit determines its evolution.",
        "It flies on wings of apple skin and spits a powerful acid. It can also change its shape into that of an apple.",
        "Its body is covered in sweet nectar, and the skin on its back is especially yummy. Children used to have it as a snack.",
        "It spews sand from its nostrils. While the enemy is blinded, it burrows into the ground to hide.",
        "Its unique style of coiling allows it to blast sand out of its sand sac more efficiently.",
        "This hungry Pokémon swallows Arrokuda whole. Occasionally, it makes a mistake and tries to swallow a Pokémon other than its preferred prey.",
        "After it’s eaten its fill, its movements become extremely sluggish. That’s when Cramorant swallows it up.",
        "It spins its tail fins to propel itself, surging forward at speeds of over 100 knots before ramming prey and spearing into them.",
        "It manipulates the chemical makeup of its poison to produce electricity. The voltage is weak, but it can cause a tingling paralysis.",
        "This short-tempered and aggressive Pokémon chugs stagnant water to absorb any toxins it might contain.",
        "It wraps prey up with its heated body, cooking them in its coils. Once they’re well-done, it will voraciously nibble them down to the last morsel.",
        "While its burning body is already dangerous on its own, this excessively hostile Pokémon also has large and very sharp fangs.",
        "Its tentacles tear off easily, but it isn’t alarmed when that happens—it knows they’ll grow back. It’s about as smart as a three-year-old.",
        "Searching for an opponent to test its skills against, it emerges onto land. Once the battle is over, it returns to the sea.",
        "The teacup in which this Pokémon makes its home is a famous piece of antique tableware. Many forgeries are in circulation.",
        "Leaving leftover black tea unattended is asking for this Pokémon to come along and pour itself into it, turning the tea into a new Polteageist.",
        "If this Pokémon senses a strong emotion, it will run away as fast as it can. It prefers areas without people.",
        "Using the braids on its head, it pummels foes to get them to quiet down. One blow from those braids would knock out a professional boxer.",
        "If you’re too loud around it, you risk being torn apart by the claws on its tentacle. This Pokémon is also known as the Forest Witch.",
        "It sneaks into people’s homes, stealing things and feasting on the negative energy of the frustrated occupants.",
        "With sly cunning, it tries to lure people into the woods. Some believe it to have the power to make crops grow.",
        "Its hairs work like muscle fibers. When its hairs unfurl, they latch on to opponents, ensnaring them as tentacles would.",
        "It evolved after experiencing numerous fights. While crossing its arms, it lets out a shout that would make any opponent flinch.",
        "After many battles, it evolved dangerous claws that come together to form daggers when extended.",
        "Be cautious of the ectoplasmic body surrounding its soul. You’ll become stiff as stone if you touch it.",
        "After deflecting attacks with its hard leaf shield, it strikes back with its sharp leek stalk. The leek stalk is both weapon and food.",
        "Its amusing movements make it very popular. It releases its psychic power from the pattern on its belly.",
        "Never touch its shadowlike body, or you’ll be shown the horrific memories behind the picture carved into it.",
        "They say that any patisserie visited by Milcery is guaranteed success and good fortune.",
        "When Alcremie is content, the cream it secretes from its hands becomes sweeter and richer.",
        "The six of them work together as one Pokémon. Teamwork is also their battle strategy, and they constantly change their formation as they fight.",
        "It stores electricity in each spine. Even if one gets broken off, it still continues to emit electricity for at least three hours.",
        "It eats snow that piles up on the ground. The more snow it eats, the bigger and more impressive the spikes on its back grow.",
        "It shows no mercy to any who desecrate fields and mountains. It will fly around on its icy wings, causing a blizzard to chase offenders away.",
        "Once a year, on a specific date and at a specific time, they gather out of nowhere and form up in a circle.",
        "This Pokémon keeps its heat-sensitive head cool with ice. It fishes for its food, dangling its single hair into the sea to lure in prey.",
        "Through its horns, it can pick up on the emotions of creatures around it. Positive emotions are the source of its strength.",
        "It carries electrically roasted seeds with it as if they’re precious treasures. No matter how much it eats, it always gets hungry again in short order.",
        "If a job requires serious strength, this Pokémon will excel at it. Its copper body tarnishes in the rain, turning a vibrant green color.",
        "These Pokémon live in herds. Their trunks have incredible grip strength, strong enough to crush giant rocks into powder.",
        "The powerful muscles in its tail generate its electricity. Compared to its lower body, its upper half is entirely too small.",
        "This Pokémon lived on prehistoric seashores and was able to preserve food with the ice on its body. It went extinct because it moved so slowly.",
        "Its mighty legs are capable of running at speeds exceeding 40 mph, but this Pokémon can’t breathe unless it’s underwater.",
        "The skin on its face is impervious to attack, but breathing difficulties made this Pokémon go extinct anyway.",
        "The special metal that composes its body is very light, so this Pokémon has considerable agility. It lives in caves because it dislikes the rain.",
        "If this weak Pokémon is by itself, a mere child could defeat it. But if Dreepy has friends to help it train, it can evolve and become much stronger.",
        "Without a Dreepy to place on its head and care for, it gets so uneasy it’ll try to substitute any Pokémon it finds for the missing Dreepy.",
        "Apparently the Dreepy inside Dragapult’s horns eagerly look forward to being launched out at Mach speeds.",
        "This Pokémon has slumbered for many years. Some say it’s Zamazenta’s elder sister—others say the two Pokémon are rivals.",
        "This Pokémon slept for aeons while in the form of a statue. It was asleep for so long, people forgot that it ever existed.",
        "It was inside a meteorite that fell 20,000 years ago. There seems to be a connection between this Pokémon and the Dynamax phenomenon.",
        "If Kubfu pulls the long white hair on its head, its fighting spirit heightens and power wells up from the depths of its belly.",
        "Inhabiting the mountains of a distant region, this Pokémon races across sheer cliffs, training its legs and refining its moves.",
        "Once the vines on Zarude’s body tear off, they become nutrients in the soil. This helps the plants of the forest grow.",
        "Its entire body is made up of a single organ that generates electrical energy. Regieleki is capable of creating all Galar’s electricity.",
        "Its body is composed of crystallized dragon energy. Regidrago is said to have the powers of every dragon Pokémon.",
        "Glastrier has tremendous physical strength, and the mask of ice covering its face is 100 times harder than diamond.",
        "As it dashes through the night, Spectrier absorbs the life-force of sleeping creatures. It craves silence and solitude.",
        "Calyrex is known in legend as a king that ruled over Galar in ancient times. It has the power to cause hearts to mend and plants to spring forth."
